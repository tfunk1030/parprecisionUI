**Prompt for DeepSeek-Chat**:

My application is running on the server, but I’m encountering several issues that need to be resolved urgently:

1. **Live Weather Data**  
   - The shot calculator isn’t using live weather data, and I’m unsure whether the wind calculator is utilizing it correctly.

2. **Altitude Calculations**  
   - When playing at higher elevations, the calculations show the shot traveling longer, which is incorrect.
   - Other calculations may be correct, but I’d like to validate them as well to ensure everything is accurate.

3. **iPhone Location Issue**  
   - When accessing the localhost server via the IP address on my iPhone, there’s no prompt for location access, and my location isn’t being captured.
   - I need to know if this is a limitation of the localhost/IP approach or an issue within the app’s code/configuration.

Could you provide:
- A detailed, step-by-step **troubleshooting and resolution plan** for each of these issues  
- Any **best practices or code-level suggestions** to ensure real-time weather data integration, correct altitude calculations, and proper location permission requests on mobile devices
- Recommendations for how to **deploy and test** these fixes quickly so the app can be ready for real-life usage
